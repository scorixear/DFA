# DFA
A simple Java-Tool for DFA/NFA/eFA creation and representation.

This tool was insprired by Even Wallace from 2010 and his "Finite state machine Designer".
Please visit his website and his Designer under: [http://madebyevan.com/fsm/](http://madebyevan.com/fsm/)

Despite its ease of use, this tool has limitations in presentation and editability.

To overcome this issue, this project will provide every usability provided by the webdesigner and add an infite plane
for unlimited space and some newer options for saving Finite state machines.

Further Informations will come.
